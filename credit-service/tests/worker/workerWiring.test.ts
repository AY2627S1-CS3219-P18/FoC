//  2026-10-22: Credit transfer consumer - asserts how src/worker/main.ts constructs the
//    BullMQ Worker. Added after a mutation check: deleting `settings: { backoffStrategy }`
//    left tsc and every other test green, because they cover the strategy function but
//    not its registration. The producer publishes backoff { type: 'custom' }, so an
//    unregistered strategy means the agreed delays silently do not happen.
//    No requirements, architecture, schema, or API decisions were made by the AI tool.
