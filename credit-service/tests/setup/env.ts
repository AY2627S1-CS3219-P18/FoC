//    Uses Node's built-in process.loadEnvFile rather than adding dotenv, keeping the
//    dependency list to the stack in credit-service-context.md §4.
//    No requirements, architecture, schema, or API decisions were made by the AI tool.

//  2026-10-16: Week 7/8 catch-up - prefer .env.test so the suite never points at the
//    development database. Exported so globalSetup can reuse it.
