//  2026-10-16: Week 7/8 catch-up - the authorization seam for F19.5.1. Written but NOT
//    mounted; blocked on the user-service public key.
//    No requirements, architecture, schema, or API decisions were made by the AI tool.
//    Author review: Wee Jean
//  2026-10-19: Week 9 - unblocked by JWKS. The verifier is now async, and this composes
//    the two middlewares rather than reimplementing bearer parsing.
//    No requirements, architecture, schema, or API decisions were made by the AI tool.
