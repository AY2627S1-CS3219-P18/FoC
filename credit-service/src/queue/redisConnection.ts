//  2026-10-22: Credit transfer consumer - the Redis connection for the BullMQ worker.
//    An explicitly constructed ioredis client rather than plain connection options:
//    BullMQ 6 treats ioredis as an optional peer and cannot load it itself under
//    native ESM ("BullMQ could not load the optional 'ioredis' package"), which is
//    what this service is. The reconnect options implement the team's requirement
//    that the worker survive the broker being unavailable (2026-10-22).
//    No requirements, architecture, schema, or API decisions were made by the AI tool.
//    Author review:

import { Redis, type RedisOptions } from 'ioredis';

/**
 * Connection options for the transfer worker.
 *
 * Exported separately from the client so they can be asserted without opening a
 * socket. Each of the three is deliberate; the sibling workers set none of them and
 * rely on ioredis defaults plus `restart: unless-stopped`, which means Docker restarts
 * a crashed container rather than the process staying up through an outage.

  // Reconnect forever, backing off to a 10 s ceiling. ioredis's default stops
  // reconnecting in some failure modes; this one never does, so a broker that returns
  // after an hour is picked up with no operator action.

 * One ioredis client for the worker, with connection-level logging.
 *
 * The logging is not decoration: `removeOnComplete: true` on the producer's side means
 * a successful job leaves no trace in Redis, so the log is the only place the
 * workflow — including a broker outage and its recovery — can be watched during a demo.
