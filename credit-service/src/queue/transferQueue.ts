//  2026-10-22: Credit transfer consumer - the queue contract agreed with order-service
//    on 2026-10-20 and verified against its producer (commit cb7ed49): queue key,
//    job name, payload shape and the backoff delays. BullMQ 6.3.13 is a team-approved
//    dependency (credit-service-context.md §4).

 * configurable.
