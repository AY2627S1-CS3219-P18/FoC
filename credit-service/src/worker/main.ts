/**
 * concurrency: 1 (decision 9).
 *
 * Deliberate, not copied. Two reasons. transferCredits takes `FOR UPDATE` on two
 * balance rows inside one transaction, so parallel workers on the same pair of users
 * would queue on Postgres anyway — the parallelism would be in the pool, not in the
 * work. And one job at a time keeps a live demo legible: the log reads in order.
 * Completion volume on a campus errand platform is nowhere near needing more.
 *
 * lockDuration is left at BullMQ's 30 s default. A job that holds its lock longer is
 * treated as stalled and re-run, so the question is whether a transfer can take 30 s.
 * It is four statements and no external call: find the reservation, two guard SELECTs,
 * lock two rows, two UPDATEs, one INSERT, commit. The only way to approach 30 s is
 * waiting on a row lock held by another transaction, which at concurrency 1 within this
 * worker cannot happen, and across the API process would mean a transfer and a
 * reservation for the same user colliding — microseconds, not seconds. Measured during
 * end-to-end verification; see the log entry.
