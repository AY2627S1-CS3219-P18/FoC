/**
 * THE CLASSIFICATION TABLE (contract agreed with order-service, 2026-10-20).
 *
 * Keyed on credit-service's own error `code`, not on an HTTP status: the worker calls
 * transferCredits directly and receives the AppError object, so the code is a typed
 * field rather than something parsed back out of a response body.

 *                           |        |             | never create the courier's balance.

 *                           |        |             | nothing here can restore it.
