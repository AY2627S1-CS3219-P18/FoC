# Credit Service — Development Context

**Project:** CS3219 AY2627S1, FoC — peer-to-peer campus errand platform
**Service:** Credit Service (one of four microservices)
**Owner:** Credit Service developer
**Status:** In development, recess-week iteration

This document is the standing context for all Credit Service work. Read it before
making changes. It records requirements the team authored, decisions the team made,
and the constraints those place on implementation.

---

## 1. What FoC is

Students request items to be collected from campus food outlets; other students fulfil
and deliver them. The platform runs a **closed credit economy** — credits cannot be
bought, withdrawn, or exchanged for money, and circulate only inside the platform.
Each new user receives 20 credits at registration and earns more by completing errands.

Payment to the vendor is outside scope. Credits compensate the courier for the errand,
not for the food.

## 2. Repository layout

```
FoC-Template/                 (single repo, one folder per microservice)

├── foc-mockup/               (D1 UI prototype, React, hardcoded data)
├── compose.yaml

└── AGENTS.md
```

## 3. Service boundaries

Credit Service owns credit balances and the transaction log. It reads no other
service's database.

**External identifiers stored as references (both UUID):**

| Field | Owned by |
|---|---|
| `user_id` | User Service |
| `request_id` | Order Service |

**Inbound triggers, from other services:**

| Trigger | Source | Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| User registered | User Service | F19.1.1 |
| Request created | Order Service | F19.2.1, F19.2.3 |
| Request completed | Order Service | F19.3.1 |
| Request cancelled or expired | Order Service | F19.4.1 |

**Open questions with other teams — do not assume answers:**

1. How Credit Service authenticates callers. If User Service issues JWTs with a role
   claim, Credit verifies locally and reads the role from the token. If it issues
   opaque session tokens, Credit must call User Service per request. This blocks
   F19.5.2 and F20.2.1.
2. Whether User Service calls `POST /credits/allocate` after OTP verification, or
   Credit Service subscribes to a registration event.

## 4. Tech stack

| Layer | Choice | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Runtime | Node.js + Express | Matches the React frontend; one language across the stack |
| Database | PostgreSQL | ACID transactions, row-level locking, unique constraints |
| IDs | UUID | Team-wide convention |
| Container | Docker, via root `compose.yaml` | M7 |

**Why PostgreSQL specifically.** NFR8.1.1 and NFR8.1.2 are ACID transactions.
Concurrent balance updates need `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` on the balance row. F19.3.2 is
a unique constraint on `request_id`, enforced by the database rather than by
check-then-write application logic that can itself race. Balances and transactions are
rigidly structured with fixed fields; nothing here wants schema flexibility.

**Note on Node and concurrency.** Node's single-threaded event loop does *not* protect
balances from races — multiple containers and multiple ticks can hit the same row.
Atomicity must come from Postgres, never from assumptions about the runtime.

## 5. Schema decisions (made by the team)

### Balance representation — stored, not derived

Two columns per user: `total_balance` and `reserved_balance`. Unreserved is computed as
`total_balance − reserved_balance`.

Store two and compute the third, so there is one fewer way for the figures to disagree.

Rationale: F19.2.3 needs one `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` on a single row plus a comparison.
A derived unreserved figure would require locking the balance row *and* preventing
concurrent inserts into reservations — harder to get right and harder to justify.

Accepted risk: stored values can drift if any write path is buggy. Mitigation is a
periodic reconciliation check comparing `reserved_balance` against the sum of open
reservations.

**Every write path must update `reserved_balance` inside the same transaction as the
log write:**

| Operation | total | reserved |
|---|---|---|
| Allocation | +20 | — |
| Reservation | — | + amount |
| Transfer | − amount (requester), + amount (courier) | − amount (requester) |
| Release | — | − amount |

### Log lives in the same database, written in the same transaction

```
BEGIN
  UPDATE balance rows
  INSERT INTO transaction_log
COMMIT
```

This is what satisfies NFR8.1.2 without extra machinery — a failure rolls back the
balance change and the log entry together, so there can never be a logged transfer that
did not happen, nor a transfer with no record.

**Do not** put the log in a separate store or a message broker. That recreates the
dual-write problem the service exists to avoid.

### Append-only enforcement

`REVOKE UPDATE, DELETE` on the transaction log table for the application role. This is
how NFR8.2.3 is enforced — at the database, not in application code.

## 6. Functional requirements

> **Source of truth.** Team decision, 2026-09-26: for Credit Service, the tables below
> take precedence over `docs/FoC-ProductBacklog.md`, which is reference only. The two
> currently differ on F20.1.1 and NFR8.1.2 — see §10.

## 8. API surface

Contracts to build against. Other services are not yet available; all of these are
testable with synthetic UUIDs.

| Method | Path | Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/credits/allocate` | F19.1.1 |
| POST | `/credits/reserve` | F19.2.1, F19.2.3 |
| POST | `/credits/transfer` | F19.3.1, F19.3.2 |
| POST | `/credits/release` | F19.4.1 |
| GET | `/credits/balance/:userId` | F19.5.1 |
| GET | `/credits/transactions` | F19.5.2 |
| GET | `/credits/transactions/all` | F20.2, F20.2.1 |

## 9. Presented edge case — team's agreed solution

**Scenario.** On completion of an errand, the requester's wallet is deducted
successfully, but the connection to the database is lost before the credits are added
to the courier's wallet.

**Solution.**

1. Execute both wallet updates in a single atomic transaction that rolls back entirely
   upon failure.
2. Store the pending transfer intent in a durable message queue so the system remembers
   the owed credits even after a crash.
3. Safely retry the transfer using the unique request ID to prevent double-charging, and
   flag the transaction in the admin dashboard if all retries are exhausted.

Items 2 and 3 are not yet reflected in the FR/NFR tables. Do not implement them ahead of
the team specifying them.

## 10. Known gaps — raise, do not resolve

These are unresolved in the backlog. Flag them; do not fill them in.

1. ~~**Logging is scheduled at week 9**, after allocation, reservation, transfer and
   release are all built. F20.1 requires a log entry for every credit operation, so
   either logging moves earlier or four existing write paths get retrofitted.~~
   **RESOLVED — team decision, 2026-09-26: F20.1.1 moved to the Recess iteration.**
   Logging is built into every write path from the start. See §6.
2. ~~**NFR8.1.2 (rollback) is at week 8 but transfer is at week 7.** The guarantee should
   ship with the operation it protects.~~
   **RESOLVED — team decision, 2026-09-26: NFR8.1.2 moved to week 7**, alongside F19.3
   (transfer). See §7.
3. **No FR covers the failed-transfer terminal state** referenced in §9.
4. **No FR covers admin credit adjustment**, though NFR3.2.1 in User Service requires
   OTP before "direct credit balance adjustments".
5. **F19.5.2 and F20.2 do not state whether the field sets differ** between a user's
   view and an administrator's — only that the row scope differs.
6. **"Auditors" appear in no User Service role definition** but were referenced in an
   earlier version of F20.2.1.

## 11. Working rules

  specified here; if something is missing or contradictory, say so and stop.
- Every file carries the AI attribution header required by the course policy.
- Log all AI-assisted work in `/ai/usage-log.md`.
- Do not introduce dependencies beyond the stack in §4 without asking.
