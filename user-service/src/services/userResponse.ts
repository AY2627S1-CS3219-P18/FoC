 * AI Assistance Disclosure:
 * Tool: Claude Code (model: claude-sonnet-5), date: 2026-10-22
 * Scope: Created toUserResponse, the shared camelCase mapper for user rows, per
 *        instructions.md Stage 15c.
 *        No requirements, architecture, schema, or API decisions were made by the AI tool.
 * Author review:
 *
 * Tool: Claude Code (model: claude-sonnet-5), date: 2026-11-04
 * Scope: Added isLocked, lockedUntil and lockLevel, per instructions.md Stage 18d.
 *        No requirements, architecture, schema, or API decisions were made by the AI tool.

 *
 * Tool: Claude Code (model: claude-sonnet-5), date: 2026-11-04
 * Scope: toUserResponse now takes the requester's ID and masks email unless the row is the
 *        requester's own, per instructions.md Stage 20 (NFR3.1.1).
 *        No requirements, architecture, schema, or API decisions were made by the AI tool.

 * Tool: Claude Code (model: claude-fable-5-1), date: 2026-11-10
 * Scope: Fix F3 - isLocked now reads the DB-computed row.is_locked (clock_timestamp(),
 *        convention 5) instead of comparing against Date.now(); the mapper takes
 *        UserRowWithLock so a query that omits is_locked fails to compile.
 *        No requirements, architecture, schema, or API decisions were made by the AI tool.

 * Tool: Claude Code (model: claude-fable-5-1), date: 2026-11-10
 * Scope: Fix F4 - the mapper's input type is now SafeUserRow (no password_hash); the body is
 *        unchanged.
 *        No requirements, architecture, schema, or API decisions were made by the AI tool.

// password_hash must never leave the service layer, and DB columns stay snake_case -
// this is the one place that maps a user row to the camelCase shape every response uses.
// requesterId masks email (Stage 20) unless the row is the requester's own.
// isLocked is decided in SQL (IS_LOCKED_SQL, fix F3): the row type requires is_locked, so a
// query that forgets to select it is a compile error rather than a silently false field.
// The input type has no password_hash (SafeUserRow, fix F4); a FOR UPDATE row that does carry it
// still type-checks structurally, but only the fields listed below are ever copied out.
