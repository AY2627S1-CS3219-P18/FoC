 * Tool: Claude Code (model: claude-sonnet-5), date: 2026-11-04
 * Scope: initiateEmailChange and initiatePasswordChange now run as two transactions: phase 1
 *        checks the login lockout and the current password (counting a wrong one on the same
 *        counter as login, Stage 18b) and commits its reset/failure write on its own; phase 2
 *        does the email/password-specific checks and the OTP request. This is so a later
 *        failure in phase 2 (e.g. EMAIL_UNCHANGED) can never roll back phase 1's lockout write.
 *        Renamed throwOnUnsentOtp to unsentOtpError (returns the error instead of throwing it)
 *        for the same reason on the OTP side: a send-escalation cap hit (Stage 18c) writes the
 *        new level/block end inside the same transaction that calls requestOtp, so every
 *        caller now applies the result after that transaction commits, not inside it. Its
 *        OTP_RESEND_LIMIT message/Retry-After also now match the escalation level.
