/*
 * AI Assistance Disclosure:
 * Tool: Claude Code (model: claude-opus-5-5), date: 2026-10-20
 * Scope: Issue #4 - one tick of the transactional-outbox relay and its 1 s BullMQ job
 *        scheduler, mirroring supplier-service's src/worker/outboxRelay.ts and
 *        startRelay.ts (outbox + relay, George 2026-10-19; same as supplier-service):
 *        read the outbox, enqueue each row as job `outbox-<id>`, delete the row only
 *        after a successful enqueue, dead-letter rows with no queue, stop the tick if
 *        Redis refuses so order is kept.
 *        No requirements, architecture, schema, or API decisions were made by the AI tool.
 * Author review:
 * Scope (2026-10-20): startRelay now delegates to the shared startScheduledTask.
 *        No requirements, architecture, schema, or API decisions were made by the AI tool.
