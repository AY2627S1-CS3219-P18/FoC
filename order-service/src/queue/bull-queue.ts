 * AI Assistance Disclosure:
 * Tool: Claude Code (model: claude-opus-5-5), date: 2026-10-20
 * Scope: Issue #4 - BullMQ producer adapter and retry policy, mirroring
 *        supplier-service's src/queue/bullQueue.ts. Retry policy per George
 *        (2026-10-19): 5 attempts, exponential backoff at powers of 2. The 1 s base
 *        delay (1/2/4/8 s) is BullMQ's built-in `exponential` type and was picked by
 *        convention, not decided.
 *        No requirements, architecture, schema, or API decisions were made by the AI tool.
 * Author review: george-yeo
 * Scope (2026-10-21): Credit transfer - per-queue job options: the transfer
 *        queue gets attempts 5 with a custom backoff (the consumer supplies the powers-of-5
 *        delays), following supplier-service's split.
 *        No requirements, architecture, schema, or API decisions were made by the AI tool.
