/*
 * AI Assistance Disclosure:
 * Tool: Claude Code (model: claude-opus-5-5), date: 2026-10-20
 * Scope (2026-10-20): Issue #4 - credit client removed from the router deps (credit calls moved to
 *        the worker).
 *        No requirements, architecture, schema, or API decisions were made by the AI tool.
 * Author review: george-yeo
 * Scope (2026-10-20): Issue #5 - POST /orders/:id/accept, following the existing
 *        POST /orders/:id/<action> transition routes.
 *        No requirements, architecture, schema, or API decisions were made by the AI tool.
 * Author review: george-yeo
 * Scope (2026-10-20): Issue #6 - GET /orders/active (F12.1.3, path by convention under
 *        /orders); writes receive the order-event publisher. Authentication is applied to
 *        all of /orders by Wen Xi's middleware in app.ts. Frontend integration -
 *        GET /orders/mine.
 *        No requirements, architecture, schema, or API decisions were made by the AI tool.
 * Author review: george-yeo
 * Tool: Claude Code (model: claude-opus-5-5), date: 2026-10-22
 * Scope (2026-10-22): router.param('id') guard - a non-UUID :id answers 404
 *        ORDER_NOT_FOUND before reaching Prisma's @db.Uuid column (George).
 *        No requirements, architecture, schema, or API decisions were made by the AI tool.
 * Author review:
 * Scope (2026-10-22): GET /orders/:id (George's spec), registered after the literal
 *        /active and /mine paths so they are not captured as ids.
 *        No requirements, architecture, schema, or API decisions were made by the AI tool.
 * Author review:
 * Tool: Codex (model: GPT-6), date: 2026-11-05
 * Scope: Implemented the team-specified admin user order listing contract from chat.
 *        No requirements, architecture, schema, or API decisions were made by the AI tool.
 * Author review: tng wen xi
 * Tool: Claude Code (model: claude-opus-5-5), date: 2026-10-23
 * Scope (2026-10-23): the router takes the supplier-service client for create / edit.
 *        No requirements, architecture, schema, or API decisions were made by the AI tool.
 * Author review:
 * Tool: Claude Code (model: claude-opus-5-5), date: 2026-11-07
 * Scope (2026-11-07): applied the 2026-10-23 change onto main, keeping both suppliers and userServiceUrl.
 *        No requirements, architecture, schema, or API decisions were made by the AI tool.
 * Author review:
 * Scope (2026-11-08, Codex, model: GPT-6): Implemented team-specified status notifications and username fallback.
 * Author review: tng wen xi
 * Tool: Claude Code (model: claude-opus-5-5), date: 2026-11-09
 * Scope (2026-11-09): POST /orders gets the credits client and event sink for the synchronous
 *        reserve (George, 2026-11-09).
 *        No requirements, architecture, schema, or API decisions were made by the AI tool.
 * Author review:
 * Tool: Claude Code (model: claude-sonnet-5), date: 2026-11-09
 * Scope: Stage 28 e (instructions.md) - mounted seriesRouter at /series, before GET /:id, per
 *        the stage's API table ("registered BEFORE /:id"). No requirements, architecture,
 *        schema, or API decisions were made by the AI tool.
