# Order Service API

Base URL in Compose: `http://order-service:3000`, published on the host at
`http://localhost:${ORDER_SERVICE_PORT:-3002}`. On AWS, the ALB sends `/orders`,
`/orders/*`, `/socket.io` and `/socket.io/*` to this service.

All ids of orders, series and users are **UUIDs**. `supplierId` and
`deliveryLocationId` are supplier-service **integer** ids. Times are ISO 8601 strings.
Request bodies are JSON (`Content-Type: application/json`).

## Contents

- [Authentication](#authentication)
- [Errors](#errors)
- [The order object](#the-order-object)
- [Health](#health): `GET /health`
- [Orders](#orders): create, list, read, edit
- [Status changes](#status-changes): accept, pickup, deliver, complete, cancel
- [Admin](#admin): `GET /orders/admin/users/:userId`
- [Series (recurring errands)](#series-recurring-errands)
- [Real-time (Socket.IO)](#real-time-socketio)

## Authentication

Every route except `GET /health` needs a User Service access token:

```
Authorization: Bearer <access token>
```

The token is verified locally as RS256 against User Service's JWKS
(`{USER_SERVICE_URL}/auth/.well-known/jwks.json`, cached). The service reads two claims:
`sub` (the caller's user id) and `role`.

A missing, malformed, expired or unverifiable token returns:

```json
HTTP 401
{ "message": "Unauthorized", "code": "UNAUTHORIZED" }
```

"Admin" below means `role` is `admin` or `super admin`.

## Errors

Most errors use one envelope. When there are several validation problems, `message` holds
one message per line:

```json
{ "message": "Request is missing a supplier.\nInvalid number of credits offered." }
```

The **status-change routes are the exception**: they return `{ "ok": false, "error": "<CODE>" }`
(see [Status changes](#status-changes)).

How error codes map to HTTP status for the order routes:

| HTTP | Codes |
| ---- | ----- |
| 400 | Any validation code (`MISSING_*`, `INVALID_*`, `COMPLETE_BY_IN_PAST`, `UNKNOWN_QUERY_PARAMETER`, `INVALID_CURSOR`, `DEADLINE_NOT_REACHED`, ...) |
| 401 | `UNAUTHENTICATED` |
| 403 | `FORBIDDEN` |
| 404 | `ORDER_NOT_FOUND` |
| 409 | `ORDER_PENDING_EXISTS`, `INVALID_TRANSITION`, `ORDER_CONFLICT`, `ORDER_EXPIRED`, `ORDER_NOT_EDITABLE` |
| 422 | `SUPPLIER_NOT_FOUND`, `DELIVERY_LOCATION_NOT_FOUND`, `INSUFFICIENT_CREDITS`, `CREDIT_RESERVE_REJECTED` |
| 503 | `CREDIT_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE`, `SUPPLIER_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` |

The full list of codes and their message text is in
[`src/constants/errors.ts`](src/constants/errors.ts). An unknown path returns 404.

## The order object

Every route that returns an order returns the full stored row:

```json
{
  "id": "0193a2b4-...",
  "requesterId": "5f0c...",
  "supplierId": 12,
  "description": "2x chicken rice",
  "deliveryLocationId": 3,
  "deliveryDetails": "Level 2 study room",
  "credits": 5,
  "completeBy": "2026-11-10T09:00:00.000Z",
  "additionalDetails": null,
  "courierId": null,
  "status": "open",
  "seriesId": null,
  "failureReason": null,
  "createdAt": "2026-11-10T08:00:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-11-10T08:00:00.000Z",
  "acceptedAt": null,
  "deliveredAt": null,
  "creditReleasedAt": null,
  "version": 1
}
```

| Field | Notes |
| ----- | ----- |
| `status` | `pending`, `open`, `accepted`, `picked_up`, `delivered`, `completed`, `cancelled`, `expired` or `failed` |
| `completeBy` | Deadline. Defaults to one hour after creation when not given |
| `courierId` | Set when the order is accepted |
| `seriesId` | The series that posted it, or `null` |
| `failureReason` | Set only for series occurrences that failed or were skipped |
| `version` | Goes up by one on every change |

---

## Health

### `GET /health`

No authentication. Checks the database.

| HTTP | Body |
| ---- | ---- |
| 200 | `{ "status": "ok", "database": "up" }` |
| 503 | `{ "status": "error", "database": "down" }` |

---

## Orders

### `POST /orders` — create an order

The caller becomes the requester. The service checks the supplier and delivery location
with supplier-service (forwarding the caller's token), then reserves `credits` with
credit-service before returning.

**Body**

| Field | Type | Required | Rules |
| ----- | ---- | -------- | ----- |
| `supplierId` | integer | yes | Positive, must exist in supplier-service |
| `description` | string | yes | Non-empty |
| `deliveryLocationId` | integer | yes | Positive, must exist in supplier-service |
| `deliveryDetails` | string | yes | Non-empty after trimming, at most 250 characters (stored trimmed) |
| `credits` | integer | yes | Greater than 0 |
| `completeBy` | string or `null` | no | ISO date later than now. Omitted or `null`: one hour from now |
| `additionalDetails` | string or `null` | no | Any text |

```json
{
  "supplierId": 12,
  "description": "2x chicken rice",
  "deliveryLocationId": 3,
  "deliveryDetails": "Level 2 study room",
  "credits": 5,
  "completeBy": "2026-11-10T09:00:00.000Z"
}
```

**Responses**

| HTTP | When |
| ---- | ---- |
| 201 | Created. Body is the [order](#the-order-object), status `open` |
| 400 | A field is missing or invalid |
| 409 | `ORDER_PENDING_EXISTS`: another of the caller's orders is still being created |
| 422 | `SUPPLIER_NOT_FOUND`, `DELIVERY_LOCATION_NOT_FOUND`, `INSUFFICIENT_CREDITS` or `CREDIT_RESERVE_REJECTED` |
| 503 | supplier-service or credit-service could not be reached |

### `GET /orders` — list orders

Without `status`, lists **open** orders, the marketplace. With any other `status`, lists only
orders where the caller is the requester or courier. `pending` and `failed` cannot be listed.

**Query parameters** (all optional; unknown or repeated parameters return 400)

| Parameter | Type | Meaning |
| --------- | ---- | ------- |
| `status` | string | `open` (default), `accepted`, `picked_up`, `delivered`, `completed`, `cancelled`, `expired` |
| `location` | integer | Only this `deliveryLocationId` |
| `minCredits` | integer ≥ 0 | `credits` at least this |
| `maxCredits` | integer ≥ 0 | `credits` at most this. Must not be below `minCredits` |
| `expiresBefore` | ISO date | `completeBy` before this |
| `expiresAfter` | ISO date | `completeBy` after this, or no `completeBy` |
| `sort` | string | `completeBy` (default), `credits` or `createdAt` |
| `order` | string | `asc` (default) or `desc` |
| `cursor` | string | `nextCursor` from the previous page. Only valid with the same `sort` and `order` |

Pages hold 50 orders.

```json
HTTP 200
{ "ok": true, "orders": [ { "...": "order" } ], "nextCursor": "eyJzIjoi..." }
```

`nextCursor` is `null` on the last page. Invalid parameters return 400, naming the parameter
in brackets, e.g. `"Unknown query parameter. (foo)"`.

### `GET /orders/active` — my active deliveries

The orders the caller has accepted as courier that are `accepted`, `picked_up` or `delivered`.
Soonest-expiring first. No parameters.

```json
HTTP 200
{ "ok": true, "orders": [ { "...": "order" } ] }
```

### `GET /orders/mine` — my orders

The caller's own orders in every status, newest first. A `failed` order is included only
when it has a `failureReason` (a series occurrence).

| Parameter | Type | Meaning |
| --------- | ---- | ------- |
| `as` | string | `requester` (default): orders the caller posted. `courier`: orders the caller accepted |

```json
HTTP 200
{ "ok": true, "orders": [ { "...": "order" } ] }
```

Any other parameter, or another `as` value, returns 400.

### `GET /orders/:id` — one order

| Parameter | In | Rules |
| --------- | -- | ----- |
| `id` | path | Order UUID |

Readable by the order's requester, its courier, and admins. Anyone else can read it only while
it is `open`.

| HTTP | When |
| ---- | ---- |
| 200 | Body is the [order](#the-order-object) |
| 404 | `ORDER_NOT_FOUND`: no such order, `id` is not a UUID, or the caller may not see it |

### `PATCH /orders/:id/edit` — edit an open order

Only the requester can edit, and only while the order is `open`. `credits` cannot be changed.

**Body**: any of these fields. **`deliveryDetails` is required on every edit.**

| Field | Type | Rules |
| ----- | ---- | ----- |
| `deliveryDetails` | string | Required. Non-empty after trimming, at most 250 characters |
| `supplierId` | integer | Positive, must exist in supplier-service |
| `description` | string | Non-empty |
| `deliveryLocationId` | integer | Positive, must exist in supplier-service |
| `completeBy` | string or `null` | ISO date later than now. `null` keeps the current deadline |
| `additionalDetails` | string or `null` | Any text |

Any other field returns 400 `INVALID_FIELD`.

| HTTP | When |
| ---- | ---- |
| 200 | Body is the updated [order](#the-order-object) |
| 400 | Invalid or unsupported field |
| 403 | The caller is not the requester |
| 404 | No such order |
| 409 | `ORDER_NOT_EDITABLE` (not open) or `ORDER_CONFLICT` (changed at the same time, e.g. just accepted) |
| 422 | Supplier or delivery location not found |
| 503 | supplier-service could not be reached |

---

## Status changes

| Route | Change | Who may call it |
| ----- | ------ | --------------- |
| `POST /orders/:id/accept` | `open` → `accepted` | Anyone except the requester. The caller becomes the courier |
| `POST /orders/:id/pickup` | `accepted` → `picked_up` | The courier |
| `POST /orders/:id/deliver` | `picked_up` → `delivered` | The courier |
| `POST /orders/:id/complete` | `delivered` → `completed` | The requester |
| `POST /orders/:id/cancel` | `open`, `accepted` or `picked_up` → `cancelled` | The requester. An `accepted` or `picked_up` order only after its `completeBy` has passed |

No body. `id` is the order UUID; a non-UUID returns 404 `{ "message": "Order not found." }`.

**Success**

```json
HTTP 200
{ "ok": true, "order": { "...": "order" } }
```

**Failure**: `{ "ok": false, "error": "<CODE>" }`

| HTTP | `error` | When |
| ---- | ------- | ---- |
| 400 | `DEADLINE_NOT_REACHED` | Cancelling an accepted or picked-up order before `completeBy` |
| 403 | `FORBIDDEN` | The caller's role may not make this change |
| 404 | `ORDER_NOT_FOUND` | No such order |
| 409 | `INVALID_TRANSITION` | Not allowed from the order's current status |
| 409 | `ORDER_EXPIRED` | Accepting after `completeBy`, before the sweep marked it expired |
| 409 | `ORDER_CONFLICT` | The order changed at the same time |

What else each change does (in the background, after the response):

- **accept**: adds the courier to the order's chat; posts "The order has been accepted by
  &lt;username&gt;".
- **pickup / deliver**: posts a status message to the chat.
- **complete**: queues the credit transfer to the courier; posts a message and archives the chat.
- **cancel**: queues a credit release; posts a message and archives the chat.

The system also expires open orders past `completeBy` and auto-completes delivered orders.
These go through the same rules but have no route.

## Admin

### `GET /orders/admin/users/:userId` — a user's order history

Admins only. Every order where `:userId` is requester or courier, in every status, newest
first.

| Parameter | In | Rules |
| --------- | -- | ----- |
| `userId` | path | User UUID. Must exist in user-service (checked with the caller's token) |
| `page` | query | Positive integer, default `1`. No other query parameters are allowed |

Pages hold 10 orders.

```json
HTTP 200
{
  "totalCount": 23,
  "currentPage": 1,
  "pageSize": 10,
  "totalPages": 3,
  "orders": [ { "order": { "...": "order" }, "role": "requester" } ]
}
```

`role` is `requester` or `courier` relative to `:userId`. A page past the end returns
`orders: []`.

| HTTP | `message` from | When |
| ---- | -------------- | ---- |
| 400 | `MALFORMED_USER_ID` | `userId` is not a UUID |
| 400 | `INVALID_QUERY_PARAMETER`, `UNKNOWN_QUERY_PARAMETER` | Bad `page`, or another parameter |
| 401 | `UNAUTHENTICATED` | No usable token, or user-service rejected it |
| 403 | `FORBIDDEN` | Not an admin, or user-service refused access |
| 404 | `INVALID_USER_ID` | user-service has no such user |
| 503 | `USER_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` | user-service could not be reached or failed |

---

## Series (recurring errands)

A series posts a new order on each occurrence of an RFC 5545 recurrence rule (times in
Singapore time). Only the series' requester can read, edit or delete it.

Series routes use the same `{ "message": "..." }` envelope, with these statuses: 404
`SERIES_NOT_FOUND` (also for a non-UUID `seriesId`), 409 `SERIES_CONFLICT`, 403 `FORBIDDEN`,
400 for everything else.

**The public series object** (returned by GET and PATCH):

```json
{
  "id": "0193a2c0-...",
  "requesterId": "5f0c...",
  "supplierId": 12,
  "description": "Morning coffee",
  "deliveryLocationId": 3,
  "deliveryDetails": "Lab 4",
  "credits": 3,
  "durationMinutes": 60,
  "additionalDetails": null,
  "rrule": "FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO,WE;BYHOUR=9;BYMINUTE=0",
  "startAt": "2026-11-10T01:00:00.000Z",
  "status": "active",
  "createdAt": "...",
  "updatedAt": "...",
  "version": 0,
  "upcomingDates": ["2026-11-11T01:00:00.000Z", "..."],
  "activeOrderCount": 1
}
```

`upcomingDates` holds the next three occurrences. `activeOrderCount` counts this series'
orders that are `pending` or `open`.

### `POST /orders/series` — create a series

| Field | Type | Required | Rules |
| ----- | ---- | -------- | ----- |
| `supplierId` | integer | yes | Positive |
| `description` | string | yes | Non-empty |
| `deliveryLocationId` | integer | yes | Positive |
| `deliveryDetails` | string | yes | Non-empty after trimming, at most 250 characters |
| `credits` | integer | yes | Greater than 0 |
| `rrule` | string | yes | RRULE text without `DTSTART`, with a `FREQ`, e.g. `FREQ=DAILY;BYHOUR=9;BYMINUTE=0`. `UNTIL`/`COUNT` end it |
| `startNow` | boolean | one of these two | `true`: start now |
| `startAt` | string | one of these two | ISO date to start from. Ignored when `startNow` is `true` |
| `durationMinutes` | integer | no | 1 to 1440. Each posted order's `completeBy` is its scheduled time plus this. Default 60 |
| `additionalDetails` | string or `null` | no | Any text |

Supplier and location are checked when each occurrence is posted, not at creation.

| HTTP | When |
| ---- | ---- |
| 201 | Created. Body is the stored series row: the fields above without `upcomingDates`/`activeOrderCount`, plus `nextFireAt` and the retry fields (`currentOccurrenceAt`, `retryType`, `attemptCount`, `nextRetryAt`) |
| 400 | Missing/invalid field, `MISSING_START_TIME`, `INVALID_RULE` (does not parse, or has no future occurrence) |

### `GET /orders/series/mine` — my series

The caller's series, newest first.

```json
HTTP 200
{ "ok": true, "series": [ { "...": "public series" } ] }
```

### `GET /orders/series/:seriesId` — one series

| HTTP | When |
| ---- | ---- |
| 200 | Body is the public series |
| 403 | Not the caller's series |
| 404 | No such series |

### `PATCH /orders/series/:seriesId/edit` — edit a series

**Body**: any of `supplierId`, `description`, `deliveryLocationId`, `deliveryDetails`,
`credits`, `durationMinutes`, `additionalDetails`, `rrule` (same rules as create), and
`status` (`active` or `inactive`, to pause or resume). Any other field returns 400
`INVALID_FIELD`.

- Changing `rrule` restarts the rule from now.
- Setting `status` to `active` on a paused series recalculates its next occurrence.
- Orders it already posted are not changed.
- If an occurrence was waiting to be retried, that occurrence is recorded as failed and the
  requester is notified.

| HTTP | When |
| ---- | ---- |
| 200 | Body is the updated public series |
| 400 | Invalid field, `INVALID_STATUS`, `INVALID_RULE` |
| 403 | Not the caller's series |
| 404 | No such series |
| 409 | `SERIES_CONFLICT`: changed at the same time |

### `DELETE /orders/series/:seriesId` — delete a series

Orders it already posted stay and lose their `seriesId`. A pending retry is recorded as
failed and the requester is notified.

| HTTP | When |
| ---- | ---- |
| 200 | `{ "ok": true }` |
| 403 | Not the caller's series |
| 404 | No such series |

---

## Real-time (Socket.IO)

Connect to the service's origin with the Socket.IO client (path `/socket.io`), passing the
same access token in the handshake `auth`:

```js
io(origin, { transports: ['websocket'], auth: { token: accessToken } })
```

The server accepts the WebSocket transport only (no long-polling).

A bad token fails the connection with `connect_error` `"unauthorized"`. The server
disconnects the socket when the token expires; reconnect with a fresh token.

On connect the server joins the socket to the caller's user room and to every order room it
is part of, then emits `ready`.

| Client → server | Effect |
| --------------- | ------ |
| `listing:subscribe` | Join the open-order feed |
| `listing:unsubscribe` | Leave it |

| Server → client | Sent when |
| --------------- | --------- |
| `order:created` | An order becomes open |
| `order:accepted`, `order:pickedUp`, `order:delivered`, `order:completed` | The matching status change |
| `order:cancelled`, `order:expired`, `order:failed` | The order ends without completing |
| `order:edited` | An open order is edited |

Payloads are small (`orderId`, `status`, `version`, `occurredAt`, plus listing-card fields
on the open-order feed, or a reason on failures). Treat them as a hint to refetch over REST.
