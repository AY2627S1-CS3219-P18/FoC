# order-service

FoC order microservice. **Node.js · Express 5 · TypeScript (ESM, strict) · Prisma 7 · PostgreSQL 17**

Owns its own database (`order-db`). No other service reads or writes it directly.

## Quick start

From the **repo root**:

```bash
cp .env.example .env                                   # once
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.dev.yaml up --build --watch
```

- API: http://localhost:3002 (`ORDER_SERVICE_PORT`)
- Health: http://localhost:3002/health → `{"status":"ok","database":"up"}`
- DB from host: `localhost:5433` (`ORDER_DB_PORT`)

Edits under `src/` are synced into the container and `tsx watch` restarts the server.
Changing `package.json` rebuilds the image. Changing `prisma/` restarts the container,
which re-runs `prisma generate` and `prisma migrate deploy`.

Production-like image (compiled JS, non-root): `docker compose up --build order-service`

## Running on the host instead of in Docker

```bash
docker compose up -d order-db           # just the database (from repo root)
cd order-service
cp .env.example .env
npm ci
npm run db:generate
npm run dev
```

## Database workflow (Prisma)

1. Edit `prisma/schema.prisma`.
2. From `order-service/` with `.env` set and `order-db` running:
   `npm run db:migrate -- --name <what_changed>`
   This creates a SQL migration under `prisma/migrations/`, applies it, and regenerates the client.
3. **Commit the migration folder.** Containers apply committed migrations on start (`migrate deploy`).

| Script        | What it does                                                            |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `db:generate` | Regenerate the typed client into `src/generated/prisma` (git-ignored)   |
| `db:migrate`  | `prisma migrate dev`: create + apply a migration (dev only)             |
| `db:deploy`   | `prisma migrate deploy`: apply pending migrations (what containers run) |
| `db:reset`    | Drop, recreate, re-apply all migrations (destroys data)                 |
| `db:studio`   | Prisma Studio GUI                                                       |

## Other scripts

| Script                             |                                                                               |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dev`                              | `tsx watch src/server.ts`: run TS directly with restart on change             |
| `build` / `start`                  | `tsc` to `dist/`, run compiled output                                         |
| `typecheck`                        | `tsc --noEmit` (tsx does **not** type-check; run this or rely on your editor) |
| `test` / `test:watch` / `test:cov` | Unit tests (Vitest, `src/**/*.spec.ts`)                                       |
| `test:e2e`                         | E2E tests (`test/*.e2e-spec.ts`), **need a running DB**                       |
| `lint` / `format`                  | oxlint (type-aware) / Prettier                                                |

## Conventions / gotchas

- **ESM.** Relative imports need the `.js` extension (`import { x } from './x.js'`).
  `verbatimModuleSyntax` is on, so type-only imports must use `import type`.
- **Dependency injection by factory.** Routers take their deps as arguments
  (`healthRouter(prisma)`), and `createApp` wires them. Tests pass fakes. See `src/app.spec.ts`.
- **Async errors.** Express 5 forwards rejected promises from async handlers to the
  error handler, so no `asyncHandler` wrapper is needed.
- New env var → `src/config/env.ts`, `order-service/.env.example`, root `.env.example`,
  and the `order-service` block in `../compose.yaml`.
- Node: Docker uses Node 24 LTS; Node ≥ 22 works on the host.

## Admin user order history

`GET /orders/admin/users/:userId?page=1`

Requires the admin's bearer token. Only `admin` and `super admin` roles may access it.
`userId` must be a UUID. The endpoint forwards the bearer token to User Service's
`GET /users/:id` to check existence before querying orders.

The optional `page` query parameter defaults to 1 and must be a positive integer.
Page size is 10, configured by `ADMIN_USER_ORDERS_PAGE_SIZE` in
`src/services/order-listing.service.ts`. Search, filters and configurable sorting
are not supported; unknown query parameters return 400.

```json
{
  "totalCount": 23,
  "currentPage": 1,
  "pageSize": 10,
  "totalPages": 3,
  "orders": [
    {
      "order": { "id": "…", "requesterId": "…", "courierId": "…" },
      "role": "requester"
    }
  ]
}
```

The example abbreviates `order`: every persisted order field is returned, including
status and timestamps. Each entry's `role` is `requester` or `courier` relative to
`:userId`. Orders include every status and are sorted by `createdAt` descending,
then ID ascending for equal timestamps. There is no persisted completion timestamp.
No credit-service transactions are fetched by this endpoint.

`totalCount` counts all matching orders, not just the page. An existing user with
no orders receives `orders: []`, `totalCount: 0` and `totalPages: 0`. A page beyond
the last page returns an empty array with the actual count and requested page.

Errors use the existing `{ "message": "..." }` envelope:

| HTTP | Internal ErrorCode         | Condition                                                                               |
| ---- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 400  | `MALFORMED_USER_ID`        | User ID is not a UUID                                                                   |
| 400  | `INVALID_QUERY_PARAMETER`  | Invalid page                                                                            |
| 400  | `UNKNOWN_QUERY_PARAMETER`  | Unsupported query parameter                                                             |
| 401  | `UNAUTHENTICATED`          | Missing/invalid authentication, including User Service rejection                        |
| 403  | `FORBIDDEN`                | Actor is not admin/super admin, or User Service rejects access                          |
| 404  | `INVALID_USER_ID`          | User Service reports that the user does not exist                                       |
| 503  | `USER_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` | User lookup connection failure or unsuccessful upstream response other than 401/403/404 |

The enum names above are internal; response bodies contain the message, following
existing order-controller conventions.

## Chat delivery after reservation

After successful credit reservation, the `pending` to `open` transaction writes
one `chat_create` task into the existing outbox. Its payload contains `orderId`,
`requesterId`, `orderDescription` and a UUID `messageId` generated once and retained
across delivery retries. The existing order-side BullMQ worker consumes it from
`queue:order:credit`, first calling `POST /chat/conversations`, then
`POST /chat/send-system-notification` with the exact text
`The order has been created`.

The existing five-attempt retry settings apply (1, 2, 4 and 8 second delays).
Network errors and HTTP 5xx are retryable; other unsuccessful HTTP responses are
permanent failures. Final failures enter the existing dead-letter handling. Chat
failures do not change the order status or release its credits. Identical chat
creation and notification retries return success without duplicate records.

The worker requires `CHAT_SERVICE_API_KEY` matching Chat Service's key.
`CHAT_SERVICE_URL` defaults to `http://localhost:3005` for host execution; Compose
sets `http://chat-service:3000`. Set these in the deployed worker environment too.

## Status change notifications

The team specified these messages in the 2026-11-08 implementation conversation:

| Transition                          | System message                                  |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Any allowed transition to cancelled | The order has been cancelled                    |
| open → expired                      | The order has expired                           |
| open → accepted                     | The order has been accepted by &lt;username&gt; |
| accepted → picked_up                | The order has been picked up                    |
| picked_up → delivered               | The order has been delivered                    |
| delivered → completed               | The order has been marked as completed          |

Each successful transition writes a `chat_notification` outbox task in the same
transaction as the status change, alongside any existing credit tasks. Its payload
is `{ orderId, messageId, message }`. A UUID `messageId` is generated once and
retained through BullMQ retries. The existing order-side queue, retry settings,
failure classification and dead-letter handling apply. Automatic expiry and
completion use the same transition path. Existing allowed transitions are unchanged.

For acceptance, order-service forwards the courier's Authorization header to
`GET /users/me` using `USER_SERVICE_URL`, and uses the returned `username`.
An unsuccessful lookup, network error, malformed response or missing username
uses `The order has been accepted`. Only the final text is queued; the bearer
token is not stored in the outbox. Delivery uses the existing
`POST /chat/send-system-notification` endpoint.

## Courier chat participation on acceptance

Team decisions supplied on 2026-11-08: accepting an order adds its courier as a
chat participant through `POST /chat/orders/:orderId/participants`, with body
`{ "userId": "<accepting courier UUID>", "role": "COURIER" }` and existing service-key
authentication. The acceptance transaction writes a `chat_participant` outbox task
before its existing notification task. The order remains accepted if delivery fails.
The worker uses the existing order-side queue, five attempts and exponential
backoff for network/5xx failures. A 409 is permanent and stops retries; existing
permanent-error/dead-letter handling applies to other 4xx responses too.

This affects new acceptances; existing accepted orders are not backfilled.
Verification: 691 tests passed; typecheck, build and lint passed. A local Postman
HTTP simulation returned 503 then 409 to the compiled client/worker: the first
error was retryable, the second was final, and neither accessed order or credit
state. No real Redis retry scheduling or live cross-service persistence was tested.

## Chat archiving on completion and cancellation

Team decision supplied in chat (2026-11-10): send the final status message first,
then archive the conversation using `POST /chat/orders/:id/archive`, with no body
and the existing service key. Completed orders (including automatic completion)
and cancelled orders set `archiveAfter: true` in their existing `chat_notification`
outbox payload. The client sends the notification before calling archive.
Transient failures use the existing worker retry policy; retries reuse the message
ID, which chat-service deduplicates even after archiving. Other status
notifications do not archive chats. No database schema change is required.
