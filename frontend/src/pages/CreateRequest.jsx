 * Tool: Claude Code (model: claude-opus-5-5), date: 2026-10-20
 * Scope: Order Service frontend integration - Post sends POST /orders (supplier id, delivery
 *        location id from the supplier-service location list, credits, optional complete-by and
 *        details), then shows a spinner until the reservation outcome arrives (order:created /
 *        order:cancelled with its reason over the socket, with a /orders/mine re-check as a
 *        fallback) and opens My activity. The stay-open and scheduled-posting fields stay hidden
 *        (George, 2026-10-20) and their unused state is removed.
 *        No requirements, architecture, schema, or API decisions were made by the AI tool.
 * Author review: george-yeo
 * Scope (2026-10-20): Carried over Wen Xi's edit page (merged in PR #115) onto this form, per
 *        George: /requests/:id/edit loads the errand from GET /orders/mine, mounts the form with
 *        its fields, hides the offer, and saves with PATCH /orders/:id/edit (delivery location
 *        id, complete-by or null, details or null).
 *        No requirements, architecture, schema, or API decisions were made by the AI tool.
 * Author review: george-yeo
 * Scope (2026-10-20): Rebased onto PR #115. George chose to keep this implementation, so the
 *        version of this file described in Wen Xi's entries above was replaced.
 *        No requirements, architecture, schema, or API decisions were made by the AI tool.
 * Author review: george-yeo
 * Scope (2026-10-20): `failed` status - the reservation outcome is order:created or
 *        order:failed (with its reason); the re-check treats an order missing from
 *        /orders/mine as failed, since that list leaves failed orders out.
 *        No requirements, architecture, schema, or API decisions were made by the AI tool.
 * Author review: george-yeo
 * Scope (2026-10-20): Login prompt waits for the session restore (sessionReady), as

 * Author review: George Yeo
 * Scope (2026-11-09): POST /orders is synchronous (George, 2026-11-09) - Post waits for the

 * Scope: Stage 28 g (instructions.md) - added `seriesMode`: the same form now also creates/
 *        edits a recurring errand (/series/new, /series/:id/edit), reusing every shared
 *        field (supplier, description, location, details, credits, additional details) and
 *        adding series-only sections: Start (now/later - revives and repurposes the
 *        commented-out "Schedule for later" stub below, since there is no separate
 *        single-post scheduling feature), Repeat (RecurrencePicker), and a "deliver by"
 *        date/time picker whose gap from the start time becomes durationMinutes. The normal
 *        order path (seriesMode omitted/false) is unchanged.
 *        No requirements, architecture, schema, or API decisions were made by the AI tool.

 * Tool: Claude Code (model: claude-sonnet-5), date: 2026-11-10
 * Scope: Stage 32 (instructions.md) - the normal errand form (/requests/new) now also creates
 *        delayed and recurring errands directly, replacing the separate /series/new route and
 *        the seriesMode-gated create UI: a "When should this order be sent?" toggle (Send
 *        now/Send later) and a "Repeat this errand" checkbox that expands the recurrence
 *        picker inline. ASAP is hidden under "When do you need it by?" whenever Send later is
 *        chosen (team decision); a one-time scheduled errand is a series with rrule
 *        "...;COUNT=1". The credits remark/hint under "When do you need it by?" stay visible
 *        whenever Send now is chosen, including with Repeat ticked (team decision), and are
 *        hidden for Send later. Editing a series (/series/:id/edit) is otherwise unchanged:
 *        its start time still cannot be edited here, since PATCH /orders/series/:id/edit has
 *        no field for it (order-service) - flagged to the team rather than worked around, and
 *        the team decided to leave that gap for a future stage. The duration computed from
 *        "deliver by" minus the start time is now a hard validation error past 24 hours
 *        (max 1440 minutes) rather than silently capped, for both creating and editing a
 *        series, per the stage's test list.
