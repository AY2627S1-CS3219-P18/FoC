 * AI Assistance Disclosure:
 * Tool: Claude Code (model: claude-sonnet-5), date: 2026-11-06
 * Scope: Stage 26e - frontend mirror of user-service's AUDIT_REASON_CODES
 *        (src/constants/auditReasons.ts), for the reason dialog's dropdown and the audit log
 *        page's reason-code filter. The codes and their order must match the backend's list
 *        exactly; descriptions are transcribed verbatim from instructions.md Stage 26's "Preset
 *        codes" table. Flagged in the usage log that the two lists must be kept in sync.
 *        No requirements, architecture, schema, or API decisions were made by the AI tool.
