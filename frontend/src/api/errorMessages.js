 * AI Assistance Disclosure:
 * Tool: Claude Code (model: claude-sonnet-5), date: 2026-10-22
 * Scope: Created the backend-code → frontend-text map, per instructions.md Stage 16b. Every
 *        code enumerated here was found by grepping user-service for `new AppError(` plus its
 *        two middleware-level codes (UNAUTHORIZED, FORBIDDEN) and the generic VALIDATION_ERROR
 *        / INTERNAL_ERROR from its global error handler (src/app.ts). `display` is the type
 *        each code uses by default: 'field' (inline under the specific field), 'banner'
 *        (whole-form), or 'toast' (background action). A screen may still choose a different
 *        display for a given code where its own spec says so (e.g. Login shows
 *        ACCOUNT_SUSPENDED in a banner, which matches the default here, but Login diverts
 *        ACCOUNT_NOT_VERIFIED to a redirect instead of showing it at all).
 *        No requirements, architecture, schema, or API decisions were made by the AI tool.

 * Tool: Claude Code (model: claude-sonnet-5), date: 2026-10-23
 * Scope: Reworded OTP_RESEND_LIMIT to name the actual wait ("about an hour"), per
 *        instructions.md Stage 16d's note for the forgot-password resend limit. Checked
 *        user-service/.env.example: OTP_RESEND_WINDOW_MINUTES=60 is one shared config across
 *        every OTP purpose (registration included), not forgot-password-specific, so the
 *        corrected wording applies to this one central entry rather than a per-page override.
 *        No requirements, architecture, schema, or API decisions were made by the AI tool.
