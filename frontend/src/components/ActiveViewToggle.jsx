 * Tool: Claude Code (model: claude-sonnet-5), date: 2026-10-23
 * Scope: Created the requester/courier view toggle, per instructions.md Stage 16f. Reads
 *        AuthContext.user.activeView and calls AuthContext.setActiveView, which already does
 *        the optimistic update + revert-on-failure (built in Stage 16b in anticipation of this
 *        sub-stage); this component only renders the two segments and shows a toast on the
 *        error setActiveView rethrows.
 *        No requirements, architecture, schema, or API decisions were made by the AI tool.

 * Tool: Claude Code (model: claude-opus-5-5), date: 2026-11-09
 * Scope (2026-11-09): Switching view while on a page of the old view only (e.g. Suppliers ->
 *        courier) now goes to the new view's main page (Find errands / Suppliers) instead of
 *        showing the blocked-page message, and back to the original page if the switch fails
 *        (George, 2026-11-09; replaces Stage 22's "user stays on the current page" for the
 *        toggle). Opening another view's page directly still shows the blocked page.
 *        No requirements, architecture, schema, or API decisions were made by the AI tool.

 * Tool: Claude Code (model: claude-sonnet-5), date: 2026-11-10
 * Scope: Stage 29 - the leaving-page redirect now replaces the history entry (instructions.md
 *        Stage 29's "History" row) and shows the "You are now in <view> mode" toast on success,
 *        matching every other redirect this stage adds. The failure revert now explicitly
 *        navigates back to the page the user was on (replace, not push, and only if they are
 *        still on the main page the toggle sent them to) instead of relying on navigate(-1),
 *        per the stage's "Toggle failure" row; locationRef tracks the live pathname since the
 *        async closure's own `location` is stale by the time the revert runs.
 *        No requirements, architecture, schema, or API decisions were made by the AI tool.
