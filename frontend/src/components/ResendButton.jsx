 * AI Assistance Disclosure:
 * Tool: Claude Code (model: claude-sonnet-5), date: 2026-10-22
 * Scope: Created ResendButton, per instructions.md Stage 16b: during cooldown it disables
 *        itself with a countdown read from the service's Retry-After header (surfaced as
 *        err.retryAfterSeconds by api/http.js); on OTP_RESEND_LIMIT it disables itself and
 *        shows the limit text with no countdown, using errorMessages.js's OTP_RESEND_LIMIT
 *        entry so the wording stays centralised. Any other error is handed to the caller via
 *        onError (e.g. NO_PENDING_REGISTRATION, which the decisions table shows as a banner).
 *        No requirements, architecture, schema, or API decisions were made by the AI tool.

 * Tool: Claude Code (model: claude-sonnet-5), date: 2026-10-23
 * Scope: Added an optional `label` prop (default unchanged: "Resend code"), so Register.jsx
 *        can reuse the same cooldown/limit-aware control for its "Send a new code" button
 *        (instructions.md Stage 16c) without a second, separately-stateful resend control.
 *        No requirements, architecture, schema, or API decisions were made by the AI tool.

 * Tool: Claude Code (model: claude-sonnet-5), date: 2026-11-06
 * Scope: Stage 25b of instructions.md - converted to forwardRef and exposed an imperative
 *        startCooldown(seconds) handle (same pattern as OtpInput's reset()), so a page can
 *        start the countdown itself from a 429 OTP_ATTEMPTS_EXCEEDED response's
 *        retryAfterSeconds, not only from this component's own resend call. 0 starts the
 *        button enabled immediately. Also added an initialCooldown prop, seeding the same
 *        state on mount: ForgotPassword's step-3-to-step-2 fallback unmounts this component
 *        (step 3 has no OTP step) before it can call startCooldown via the ref, so it needs
 *        the cooldown to already be correct the moment this component (re)mounts in step 2.
 *        The existing OTP_RESEND_COOLDOWN/OTP_RESEND_LIMIT handling inside handleClick is
 *        unchanged.
 *        No requirements, architecture, schema, or API decisions were made by the AI tool.
