 * AI Assistance Disclosure:
 * Tool: Claude Code (model: claude-sonnet-5), date: 2026-10-22
 * Scope: Created RequireAuth and RequireRole, per instructions.md Stage 16b. While the session
 *        is still restoring, both render nothing rather than redirect, so a logged-in user on
 *        reload never flashes a login page. The role rank order mirrors the backend's
 *        authorize middleware (user-service/src/middleware/authorize.ts: user < admin <
 *        super admin).
 *        No requirements, architecture, schema, or API decisions were made by the AI tool.

 * Tool: Claude Code (model: claude-sonnet-5), date: 2026-11-05
 * Scope: Added ViewGate, per instructions.md Stage 22's "Opening another view's page" and
 *        "Toggling the view" rows. It reads user.activeView straight from AuthContext on every
 *        render, so toggling the view elsewhere (the nav's ActiveViewToggle) re-renders any
 *        mounted ViewGate automatically, including the toast-and-revert case on a failed
 *        toggle - no extra wiring between the two. Rendered inside RequireAuth (App.jsx), so
 *        user is never null here; the guard is defensive only.
 *        No requirements, architecture, schema, or API decisions were made by the AI tool.

 * Tool: Claude Code (model: claude-sonnet-5), date: 2026-11-10
 * Scope: Stage 29 - ViewGate now redirects (Navigate replace) to the current view's main page
 *        instead of rendering the blocked-page message, and shows the "You are now in <view>
 *        mode" toast once per redirect. Removed the switch/go-to-main-page buttons and the
 *        blocked-page EmptyState markup entirely, per the stage's "Blocked-page component:
 *        Removed" row.
 *        No requirements, architecture, schema, or API decisions were made by the AI tool.
