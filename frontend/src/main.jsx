 * Tool: Claude Code (model: claude-sonnet-5-5), date: 2026-09-30
 * Scope: Removed the admin mock store provider now that the admin screens use the Supplier Service. No requirements, architecture, schema, or API decisions were made by the AI tool.

 * Tool: Claude Code (model: claude-sonnet-5), date: 2026-10-22
 * Scope: Mounted AuthProvider and ToastProvider, per instructions.md Stage 16b. AuthProvider
 *        wraps DemoProvider so DemoContext's (now demo-only) state stays independent of auth;
 *        both need the router, so they sit inside BrowserRouter.
 *        No requirements, architecture, schema, or API decisions were made by the AI tool.
