// TEAM DECISION (2026-09-30): supplier objects use exactly the fields the Supplier Service API
// returns (§7.3). Mockup field -> API field, as resolved by the team:
//   id (string)      -> id (number)
//   venue            -> location
//   location         -> faculty
//   shortName        -> removed
//   category         -> categories[] (shown as pills)
//   description      -> desc (detail view only; the list does not show it)
//   image            -> photos[].photoLocation (the API returns signed URLs)
//   activeRequests   -> deferred (Order Service data, not supplier-service)
//
// PLACEHOLDER MOCK VALUES, not team data: `type` ('Store' everywhere), `level` (1 everywhere),
// every supplier's opening hours (the same each day, Mon-Sun), and `photoLocation`, which points
// at local files under /images/ until real signed URLs exist. Suppliers that had no venue use
// their old location text as `location` because the API requires one.

// `hours` is expanded to one openingHours entry per day (1 = Monday .. 7 = Sunday, §6.2) because
// the detail response carries per-day hours. The list response does not, so list views never
// read it.
