 * AI Assistance Disclosure:
 * Tool: Claude Code (model: claude-sonnet-5), date: 2026-09-29
 * Scope: Defined the persistence interface the business layer depends on, as required by
 *        SupplierServiceArchitecture.md §5 and SupplierServiceSpec.md Phase 0/1. Read operations
 *        only; the visibility rule (§7) is part of every query. No requirements, architecture,
 *        schema, or API decisions were made by the AI tool.
 * Author review: Congchen
 * Scope (2026-09-29, Claude Code, model: claude-sonnet-5): updated the `dayOfWeek` comment to the
 *        1–7 plus reserved-8 convention (SupplierServiceArchitecture.md §6.2). No requirements,
 *        architecture, schema, or API decisions were made by the AI tool.
 * Author review: Congchen
 * Scope (2026-09-29, Claude Code, model: claude-sonnet-5): added AdminSupplierRow and the admin
 *        read operations per Phase 2 plan Task 3 (Arch §7). No requirements, architecture, schema,
 *        or API decisions were made by the AI tool.
 * Author review: Congchen
  * Scope (2026-09-30, Claude Code, model: claude-sonnet-5-5): returned location_id, faculty_id and categories as {category, category_id} objects in supplier responses. Per the team's
 *        decision in chat; no other requirements, architecture, schema, or API decisions were made by the
 *        AI tool.
