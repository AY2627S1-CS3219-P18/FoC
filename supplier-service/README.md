# Supplier Service

See [SupplierServiceArchitecture.md](./SupplierServiceArchitecture.md) for the decided architecture
and [SupplierServiceSpec.md](./SupplierServiceSpec.md) for the phased implementation plan.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # fill in DB/Redis/User Service values for your environment
npm run migrate        # applies src/db/init.sql (§6.4 schema)
npm run dev
```

## Environment variables

See `.env.example` for the full list: server port, MySQL connection, Redis connection, and
`USER_SERVICE_URL` (used by the auth middleware to call the User Service's `GET /auth/verify`).
The optional `PHOTO_STORE_ENDPOINT`, `PHOTO_STORE_BUCKET`, `PHOTO_STORE_ACCESS_KEY` and
`PHOTO_STORE_SECRET_KEY` point the photo storage interface at an S3-compatible store (the local
MinIO below); without them, photo operations fail with `500`.

## Upgrading an existing database

`npm run migrate:phase2` upgrades a database created from the pre-Phase 2 `init.sql`: it adds
`supplier_hours.is_24h`, moves `day_of_week` from 0–6 to 1–7 (Sunday 0 becomes 7) and widens the
check to 1–8. It is safe to run more than once. New databases get this schema from `init.sql`.

`npm run migrate` re-applies `init.sql` and creates the `outbox` table on an existing database. A
database created before Phase 2 also needs `npm run migrate:phase2` before supplier creation works.

## Background worker

The worker is a separate process from the API (`src/worker/main.ts`).

```bash
npm run worker                          # run the worker (npm run worker:dev restarts it on change)
docker compose up -d supplier-worker    # run it as the compose service (from the repository root)
```

- Every second a relay (a BullMQ job scheduler on `queue:outbox:relay`) reads up to 100 `outbox` rows
  ordered by `version` then `id`, adds each to its BullMQ queue (job id `outbox-<outbox id>`, job name =
  `task_name`, job data = `payload`) and deletes the row once it has been added. If adding fails, the
  row is kept and retried on the next tick. Ordering is enqueue order only.
- Queues: `supplier_suspension` jobs go to `queue:supplier:suspension` (payload `{ supplier_id }`);
  `image_cleanup` jobs go to `queue:image:cleanup` (payload `{ photo_id, photo_location }`). A queue
  key maps to BullMQ as prefix plus name split at the last colon (`queue:supplier:suspension` is prefix
  `queue:supplier`, name `suspension`).
- A failed job is retried as a BullMQ delayed job, up to 5 attempts in total, with delays of 5 s,
  25 s, 125 s and 625 s. The worker is not blocked while a job waits.
- A job that has used all attempts, a job with an unknown name or an invalid payload (no retry), and an
  outbox row whose `task_name` has no queue are written to `dead_letter_jobs` (`job_id`
  `outbox-<outbox id>`, `status` `UNRESOLVED`).
- The suspension job calls the Order Service delete and then the Message Service notify. Both are
  mocks that log a line and do nothing else; set `MOCK_DOWNSTREAM_FAILURE=true` to make them fail.
- On `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` the worker takes no new jobs and lets the active job finish. Observed on
  2026-09-30 with an idle worker under `docker stop`: it stopped in about 3 s, the log showed
  `SIGINT` (not `SIGTERM`), and the exit code was 143. Stopping during an in-flight job has not been
  tested.
- `PHOTO_STORE_ENDPOINT` is `http://host.docker.internal:9000` in development and must be the same
  string in the API and the worker. Photos stored earlier with a `http://localhost:9000` prefix cannot
  be deleted by the worker.

## Local photo store (development and unit tests only)

Supplier photos go through a provider-agnostic storage interface
(`SupplierServiceArchitecture.md` §8.2). Locally, and in unit tests, that interface is backed by a
MinIO instance that simulates the cloud object storage. It is defined in `compose.photo-store.yaml`
in this folder and is not part of the root `compose.yaml`, because it is not used in deployment.

```bash
docker compose -f compose.photo-store.yaml up -d     # start it (run from supplier-service/)
docker compose -f compose.photo-store.yaml ps        # wait until photo-store reports healthy
docker compose -f compose.photo-store.yaml down      # stop it (add -v to also delete its data)
```

The S3 API listens on host port `9000` and the web console on `9001` (override with
`PHOTO_STORE_API_PORT` / `PHOTO_STORE_CONSOLE_PORT`). The one-shot `photo-store-init` service creates
the `supplier-photos` bucket. The development-only credentials are `photostoredev` /
`photostoredev-secret` (override with `PHOTO_STORE_ACCESS_KEY` / `PHOTO_STORE_SECRET_KEY`). The
instance must be running before `npm run test:minio` (see Tests) is run.

## API (Phase 1 — requester mode)

All routes below are versioned under `/api/v1` and require a valid User Service bearer token.
Accepted roles: `user`, `admin`, `super admin` (§7).

| Method & path | Query parameters |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/v1/suppliers` | `page`, `limit` (fixed at 50), `search`, `location_id`, `category_id`, `isOpen` (`true`/`false`), `sortOrder` (`A-Z`/`Z-A`, default `A-Z`) |
| `GET /api/v1/suppliers/:id` | — |
| `GET /api/v1/suppliers/reference/location` | — |
| `GET /api/v1/suppliers/reference/categories` | — |

See `SupplierServiceArchitecture.md` §7.2–§7.3 for the full request/response contract.

## API (Phase 2 — admin mode)

All routes require a valid bearer token with role `admin` or `super admin` (§7).

| Method & path | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/v1/admin/suppliers` | Same query parameters as the user list; includes inactive and soft-deleted suppliers and adds `isActive`, `isDeleted` |
| `GET /api/v1/admin/suppliers/:id` | Adds `isActive`, `isDeleted`, `createdOn`, `createdBy`, `updatedOn`, `version` |
| `POST /api/v1/admin/suppliers` | `multipart/form-data`: `name`, `type`, `location_id`, `category_id` (JSON array), `desc`, `openingHours` (JSON array), `is24h`, and 0–10 JPEG/PNG `photos` (≤ 5 MB each). Requires an `Idempotency-Key` UUID header. `201` on create. When the name, type and location match a soft-deleted supplier, `200`: the submitted details and photos are applied through the edit cycle and `is_deleted = false`, `is_active = true` are restored in the same transaction (submitted photos replace the existing ones; no photos submitted leaves them; `version` is bumped once). If anything fails before the commit, the supplier stays soft-deleted and unchanged |
| `PUT /api/v1/admin/suppliers/:id` | `multipart/form-data`: `name`, `type`, `desc`, `location_id`, `category_id` (JSON array; replaces the whole set), `openingHours` (JSON array), `is24h`, `isActive`, required `version`, `isPhotoDirty`, `photo_ids` (JSON array; numbers are existing photo ids, strings are placeholders), `placeholder_ids` (JSON array; the i-th placeholder matches the i-th uploaded `photos` file), and 0–10 JPEG/PNG `photos` (≤ 5 MB each). No `Idempotency-Key`. `200` with the updated admin supplier; `404` for an unknown or soft-deleted supplier; `409` for a stale `version`; `422` for a validation failure, a duplicate name/type/location, nothing to update, or files sent without `isPhotoDirty`. Excluded-photo cleanup tasks (`task_name` `image_cleanup`) are written to the `outbox` table in the update transaction and processed by the background worker (see Background worker) |
| `DELETE /api/v1/admin/suppliers/:id` | Soft-deletes the supplier (`is_deleted = true`; `is_active` unchanged; `updated_on` and `version` bumped). `200` with `{ "id": <id>, "isDeleted": true }`; `404` for an unknown or already deleted supplier; `403` for the `user` role. The delete and its `supplier_suspension` outbox row commit in one transaction |
| `POST` / `PUT /:id` / `DELETE /:id` on `/api/v1/admin/reference/faculties`, `/locations`, `/categories` | JSON bodies as in §7; `DELETE` succeeds only for an unreferenced row |

See `SupplierServiceArchitecture.md` §6.2, §7 and §8.2 for the full contract.

## Tests

```bash
npm test               # everything except the MinIO tests; needs no Docker
npm run test:minio     # tests of the real photo-store connection; needs the photo store running
```
