# Phase 5 pagination load test: local run, 2026-11-04

**Result: the team's NFR7.1 targets were NOT met in this run.** Under the 50 and 200 requests/s arrival rates the service answered at roughly 20 requests/s, k6 dropped 11,672 iterations, and every percentile was far above its limit. No index or query was changed (Phase 5 plan Task 3 step 4); the numbers are reported for the team to decide.

## Environment (what actually ran)

- All on one Windows laptop: Supplier Service (`npx tsx src/app.ts`, development mode, a single Node process), MySQL 8 and Redis 7 in Docker containers, and k6 (`grafana/k6` Docker image, reaching the service through `host.docker.internal`). Load generator, service and database therefore competed for the same machine's CPU.
- Database: a separate MySQL database seeded by `scripts/seedLoadTestData.ts` with 4,000 synthetic suppliers (17,400 hours rows, 5,334 category links, 8,000 photo rows), 10 locations, 5 categories. Names contain `errand` for 1 in 5 rows. This is synthetic data, not the CSV seed.
- Auth: local JWKS stub (`scripts/loadTestAuth.ts`) with test-only keys. `PER_IP_RATE_LIMIT=20000`. No 429 responses occurred (all 3,330 responses were 200).
- Script: `test/load/pagination.k6.js` with `CATEGORY_ID=1`, `LOCATION_ID=1`.
- One single-request check before the run: the `isOpen=true` list query took 3.46 s by itself (cold, one request), versus 0.016 to 0.32 s for the other variants. This is one measurement, not a diagnosis.
