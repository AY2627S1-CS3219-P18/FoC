/*
 * AI Assistance Disclosure:
 * Tool: Claude Code (model: claude-sonnet-5), date: 2026-09-29
 * Scope: Generated Vitest config that supplies the environment variables src/config.ts requires,
 *        using the values from .env.example, so tests can import config. No requirements,
 *        architecture, schema, or API decisions were made by the AI tool.
 * Author review: Congchen
 * Scope (2026-09-29 update): Excluded *.minio.test.ts from the default suite (Phase 2 plan, Task 2).
 *        No requirements, architecture, schema, or API decisions were made by the AI tool.
 * Author review: Congchen
 * Scope (2026-09-30, Claude Code, model: claude-sonnet-5): only run tests under the new test/
 *        folder. No requirements, architecture, schema, or API decisions were made by the AI tool.
 * Author review: Congchen
  * Scope (2026-09-30, Claude Code, model: claude-sonnet-5-5): excluded *.seed.test.ts from the default run so
 *        the seed (npm run seed) is not part of npm test. No requirements, architecture, schema, or API
 *        decisions were made by the AI tool.
